# Getting Started with Course Notes

We use **Markdown** to write our notes. This allows us to focus on *content* rather than *presentation*. Markdown files can be processed into `.html` files for publication on the web.

Notice how this markdown file has something at the top called **front matter**. This is in what's called `yaml` format (*yaml* stands for "Yet Another Markdown Language"), and it's a lot like pre-processor directives used by the rendering engine that generates the html web pages.
